## What is Flux?

Flux is a modular chat system supposed to replace the default Roblox Chat. It currently supports PC, Mobile and Tablet.
Flux is in a heavy development state. This means there are several features planned for the 1.0 release not (fully) implemented yet!

This documentation will guide you through the various features of Flux and how to install & customize it.

## Read before Using
When using Flux as-is without changing any settings, it will be ToS compliant. Though changing some of the settings can lead to moderation. I will be sure to mention these settings. Still, you are responsible for the settings you change in Flux!
